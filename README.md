# Peer Graded Assessment 1 - Little Lemon


## HTML & CSS In Depth (Course 4 of 9) Meta Front-End Developer Specialization


In this course, we used software development tools like HTML to build attractive web pages that work wellâ€”and we used structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the end user. 


### Week 1: HTML in depth

In this module, we used structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the user. We created semantic HTML to structure webpages to look good and work well.

### Week 2: Interactive CSS

In this module, I dove deeper into CSS by applying increasingly specific styling to various elements.


### Week 3: Peer Graded Assessment

In the final module, I completed the final peer-graded portfolio project for a fictional client - Little Lemon.
